    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "description": "Explore common questions about our AI Talking Head, including its features, capabilities, and how it can revolutionize your video creation process.",
    "q1": "How do I record audio directly in the browser?",
    "a1": "Simply click on the 'Record' tab in the audio input section, then press the microphone button to start recording. You'll see a timer counting the duration of your recording. Click the stop button when finished, and you can preview your recording before using it for your talking head video.",
    "q2": "What types of images work best?",
    "a2": "Clear frontal portraits work best. The face should be well-lit, with no obstructions, and looking directly at the camera. Neutral expressions typically produce the best results.",
    "q3": "How long can my audio be?",
    "a3": "For best results, keep your audio under 60 seconds. Longer content may result in lower quality or synchronization issues.",
    "q4": "What's the difference between standard and high quality?",
    "a4": "High quality processing uses more advanced AI models to create more realistic facial movements and better lip-sync. It costs more credits but produces more natural-looking results.",
    "q5": "Can I use the generated videos commercially?",
    "a5": "You are responsible for ensuring you have appropriate permission to use both the input image and the resulting video. Always get proper consent from the person in the image before creating or sharing a talking head video.",
    "q6": "Can I edit the video after it's generated?",
    "a6": "The generated video can be downloaded and then edited with any video editing software of your choice.",
    "q7": "Do you store my images or audio?",
    "a7": "We temporarily process your media to generate the talking head video, but we don't permanently store your original images or audio files.",
    "q8": "What audio formats are supported?",
    "a8": "Currently we support MP3 and WAV audio formats.",
    "q9": "Why does my generated video look unnatural?",
    "a9": "The quality depends on the input image quality, lighting, angle, facial expression, and audio quality. Try using a clearer portrait photo with good lighting and a neutral expression for best results."

    "title": "Tips for Best Results",
    "imageQuality": "Use a high-quality portrait photo with good lighting",
