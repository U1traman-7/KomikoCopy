      "description": "Frame interpolation is a technique used to increase the frame rate of a video by generating new frames between existing ones. This process can be used to create smoother motion and higher frame rates without re-recording the video. AI Frame Interpolation is a cutting-edge video enhancement technology that uses artificial intelligence to generate additional frames between existing ones, resulting in smoother motion and higher frame rates. This AI video smoothing process dramatically improves video quality and viewing experience."

  "faq": {
    "question1": "What is AI Frame Interpolation?",
    "answer1": "AI Frame Interpolation is a cutting-edge video enhancement technology that uses artificial intelligence to generate additional frames between existing ones, resulting in smoother motion and higher frame rates. This AI video smoothing process dramatically improves video quality and viewing experience.",

    "question2": "How does AI Video Frame Interpolation work?",
    "answer2": "Our AI video frame interpolation software analyzes motion between existing frames and uses advanced machine learning algorithms to generate new intermediate frames. This process increases the video's FPS (Frames Per Second) while maintaining natural motion and high quality.",

    "question3": "What are the benefits of frame interpolation?",
    "answer3": [
      "Smoother motion and animations",
      "Higher frame rates without re-recording",
      "Improved video quality",
      "Better slow-motion effects"
    ],

    "question4": "What video formats are supported?",
    "answer4": "The AI supports MP4 video format. We recommend using videos with clear motion and good quality for best results.",

    "question5": "How do I choose the right settings?",
    "answer5": "For frames per second (FPS), choose based on your needs: 24-30 FPS for standard video, 60 FPS for smooth motion. Interpolation steps determine how many frames to add between existing frames - higher values create smoother motion but take longer to process.",

    "question6": "Is there a limit to video length or size?",
    "answer6": "Yes, there are some limitations to ensure optimal processing. We recommend videos under 30 seconds and 100MB for best results. Longer videos can be processed in segments."
