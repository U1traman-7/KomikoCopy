    "questions": {
      "1": {
        "question": "What is AI layer splitting?",
        "answer": "AI layer splitting is a process that uses artificial intelligence to automatically separate an image into individual component layers. KomikoAI's AI layer splitter tool analyzes your artwork and identifies different elements like characters, backgrounds, and objects, creating separate layers that can be edited independently."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "How to split images into layers with AI?",
        "answer": "You can split your images with KomikoAI AI in two easy steps:\n1. Upload your image to the AI layer splitter\n2. Click the 'Split Image' button to start the splitting process"
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Can I use AI to separate elements in my images?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can use AI to separate elements in your images. KomikoAI's AI layer splitter tool can analyze your images and identify different components, creating individual layers for each element. This makes it easy to edit specific parts of your image without affecting the whole composition."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "How does AI layer splitting work?",
        "answer": "AI layer splitting uses advanced deep learning models trained on millions of images to recognize different elements within an image. The AI analyzes patterns, edges, colors, and context to determine which pixels belong to which objects, then creates separate layers for each identified component."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What are the benefits of AI layer splitting?",
        "answer": "There are various benefits of splitting images with AI:\n- Saves time compared to manual masking and selection\n- Produces clean, high-quality layers with precise edge detection\n- Enables easy editing of individual components\n- Perfect for creating game assets and animation elements"
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Can I use AI split layers for commercial purposes?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can use AI-generated split layers for personal and commercial purposes. This makes it ideal for game development, design projects, and professional artwork. However, ensure you comply with KomikoAI's terms of service."

      },
      "12": {
        "question": "What types of images work best with AI layer splitting?",
        "answer": "The AI layer splitter works well with various types of images:\n- Game assets and character designs\n- Illustrations and artwork\n- Photos with distinct foreground and background elements\n- Product images\n- Cartoon and anime style images\n- Digital artwork with clear components\nFor best results, use images with good contrast between different elements."
      },
      "13": {
        "question": "How can I get the best results from AI layer splitting?",
        "answer": "Follow these tips for optimal layer separation:\n- Use images with good contrast between elements\n- Ensure your image has sufficient resolution\n- Images with clear boundaries between elements work best\n- Avoid extremely cluttered or complex scenes when possible\n- Use PNG format for best quality results"
      },
      "14": {
        "question": "How does AI layer splitting compare to manual separation?",
        "answer": "AI layer splitting offers significant time savings compared to manual masking and selection, reducing hours of work to minutes. While it may not fully replace professional techniques for the most complex projects, it's an excellent tool for rapid asset creation, game development, and design workflows. The AI understands object boundaries and can create clean separations that would take considerable time and skill to achieve manually."
