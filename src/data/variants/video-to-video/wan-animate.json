We modify its input formulation to unify reference image input, temporal frame guidance, and environmental information (for dual-mode compatibility) under a common symbolic representation. For body motion control, we use skeleton signals that are merged via spatial alignment. For facial expression control, we leverage implicit features extracted from face images as the driving signal. Additionally, for character replacement, we train an auxiliary Relighting LoRA to enhance the character's integration with the new environment..",
